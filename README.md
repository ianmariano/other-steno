Convert text to hex color blocks. Somewhat straightforward and damn easy to
crack if you know what's going on.

Exciting things you can do if you're willing:

* Output standalone HTML of the color grid (or other visualization)
* Convert to a node thingy to output an image for transmission
* Do a reverse thing to recover the original text from a transmission
* Use strong encryption for generation (like AES256) for transmission and recovery
